**Prompt**: how to get the second word from every line of the output from some command Format the response as markdown without enclosing backticks.

**Response**:
You can use the `awk` command to get the second word from every line of the output from some command. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
your_command | awk '{print $2}'
```

In this command, `your_command` is the command whose output you want to process. The `awk '{print $2}'` part will print the second word from every line of the output.

Here's an example using the `ls -l` command:

```bash
ls -l | awk '{print $2}'
```

This will print the second word from every line of the output of the `ls -l` command.

Remember to replace `your_command` with the actual command you want to use.
